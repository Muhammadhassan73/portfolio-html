    <h1>MY EXPERIENCE:</h1>
    <p>Everyone has their own stories, meaningful or not it’s their life and their memories. When I been told to wrote a
        memoir about languages, I could not think about any ideas. My Professor told us that everyone has their own
        stories and it is interesting, because that is your experience not ours. People like to hear stories, because
        it’s not their experiences and they want to know what have you been through. Here are little stories about
        myself.

    <p>In order to make life in America a reality, we had to sell most of our stuff and send the remaining to America.
        Making the move was not easy, and there was a lot of pressure on my parents, but we finally settled down in
        Syosset, Ny, America. Of course, getting used to the western lifestyle was not easy and the language was a
        barrier. Renting a house, Buying a car, enrolling in school, and purchasing new furnitures were the first things
        that we had to do in America, just as we had to do in China. I taught English would be difficult to handle, but
        since I had already mastered a language besides my native language, I was not scared of taking the initiatives.
        Thus, I enrolled in the ESL program in Syosset High School. My ESL teacher was very strict and a harsh grader,
        and I did not enjoy being in her class. However, by the end of the year, when I took the ESL exit test, and
        passes it with excellent results, I saw the influence that my ESL teacher had on me. To this day, I’m thankful
        to her for not only helping me with my English, but also for making me a better student. When I finished ninth
        grade and started tenth grade, I tried to challenge myself a bit more with the academics; however my counselor
        did not recommend me to take Advance Placement classes, nor did she recommend me to exit ESL history (Even
        though I was enrolled in regular English).</p>
