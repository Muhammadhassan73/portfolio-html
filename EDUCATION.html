    <h1>MY EDUCATION:</h1>
    <P>When speaking of the topic of who a person is and their past, a massive part of this includes their educational
        background. Isn’t this what forms people, their education? Of course, this doesn’t always have to refer to their
        organized education. Everything that a person learns is something that educates them; these words being
        synonymous. Even something like first learning to tie your shoes is a part of your education. Which method works
        better for you: loop, swoop, and pull, or bunny ears? I of course, like any other well educated person, use
        loop, swoop, and pull; it’s just the best way, no bias has ever developed there.</P>
    <br>
    <p>I started out as a twinkle in my father’s eye in the fall of 1982, and then on that fateful
        Starting in Nana’s Nuggets preschool, which had a lot of interactive learning, I began my first venture into
        organized education. This was a very warm environment, same as in my home, where caring and working with others
        was very important. I made a lot of friends in this school that I actually stayed with through all of high
        school. When this short stint was finished, I graduated onto Seward Elementary School, located in the same
        buildings as the Middle and High Schools, where I first learned that kissing a girl on the hand in kindergarten
        at story time wasn’t a good idea. In the Seward Community Schools system, ones learns a lot about the natural
        world around them, and about Alaska in general, being as it is one of the worlds greatest natural resources.
        After first grade, there was a new building necessary, as the population of Seward, like any other place on
        earth, was growing. This new school was where I had a second grade teacher who had actually been in the Ms.
        America pageant, whom everyone had a crush on. I started music which I loved every minute of, as it would become
        a large part of me. As any other elementary school, this was where I learned my basic stuff of course: typing,
        addition, speling, and even crazy things like percentages!
